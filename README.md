# Stallion

Stallion is a Python Package Manager interface created to provide an "easy-to-use" visual and also
a command-line interface for Pythonistas. Today we have many nice distribution utilities like pip,
distribute, etc, but we don't have a nice visual approach to inspect current installed packages,
show projects metadata, check for PyPI updates, etc.

### Install as a service

On Linux systems having [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) you can set up Stallion as a service easily as follow.

- copy `contrib/upstart/stallion.conf` to `/etc/init/`
- make a symbolic link for it in `/etc/init.d/`:

    ```shell
    $ ln -s /etc/init/stallion.conf /etc/init.d/stallion
    ```
- copy `contrib/upstart/stallion` to `/etc/default/`

#### Service management

```shell
$ sudo start stallion
$ sudo stop stallion
$ sudo status stallion
```
or
```shell
$ sudo service stallion start
$ sudo service stallion stop
$ sudo service stallion status
```

#### Service customization

You can customize the host and port the stallion service will be listening on by editing the file `/etc/default/stallion`.


## Using Stallion

You only need to call the script (the -w option will automatically open your browser):

    $ stallion -w

   Global checking feature

      Many people asked for a global version updates checking, now you have this
      feature under the menu "PyPI Repository". This option is going to check
      updates for all your packages. A new icon will appear on the sidebar
      packages menu warning in case of a new available update.
   
   Classifiers refactoring

      The classifiers of the package are now visually different.

## Reporting bug

Open an issue in Github with the traceback. To get the traceback, you'll 
have to run Stallion in debugging mode:

    $ stallion -drvi
